Algorithms and data structures for technical interviews and competitive programming.
Feedback/suggestions and especially hefty testing of all these solutions is very much appreciated.

1- longestSubsequence.py: Given a string S, find the longest subsequence of S out of the words of a dictionary (just a list) D.

2- student_heights.py: Given an array of heights of students who enter one by one, find the minimum number of rows that can be formed by the students such that any newly joined student must be shorter than ALL the students in a certain row.

3- sums.py: Two and three sum + subset sum.

4- dictionary_queries.py: Given a bunch of words, find all the words that match a certain query that consists of characters to be matched and wildcard characters ('?') meaning any character. For example "?at" refers to "cat" or "hat". 3 methods.

5- find_duplicate.py: In an array of integers between 1 & n, where n+1 is the length of the array, find a duplicate. (https://medium.com/solvingalgo/solving-algorithmic-problems-find-a-duplicate-in-an-array-3d9edad5ad41)

6- edit_distance.rs: Gradually writing edit distance variations while practicing Rust.

7- trie.py: Just a couple of implementations of trie/prefix-tree.

8- LRU.py: LRU cache implementation. I may add another with one DS instead of 2: OrderedDict.

9- number_pad.py: Real interview question. Given a pad like those found on old cell phones, and given a sequence of digits presses, return all possible words that could have been typed.

10- interleave.py: just interleave two strings.

11- grep.py: simulate the grep command (search for a match of a string in a file and print the context of the matches, taking into account bounds and overlaps.)
